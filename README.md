This project was made as a code-along with MayanWolfe's video tutorial as a form of practice and learning. What I learned: 
1)Using brackets to 'drill down' with in an object, and getting more comfortable with looking for desired information within an object
2)Utilizing OOP via classes and encapsulation
3)Again using OOP via inheritance by extending the class
4)Setting a property within the class to be a boolean and using that within conditionals to determine whether to append one string or the other to the DOM
